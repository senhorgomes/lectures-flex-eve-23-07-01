## Security

### Security Issue #1

- Storing Passwords - why not plaintext
- How to encrypt passwords (bcrypt)
- hashing
- Solution: hash the password using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

### Security Issue #2

- User can see data in cookie and modify, becoming any other user
- Solution: encrypt the cookie using [cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session)

### Security Issue #3

- Stealing cookies
- HTTP is plain-text
- When information is sent the body being sent isn't encrypted
- Man-in-the-middle (we know NSA, etc. do this)
- Firesheep: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firesheep
- Solution: HTTPS (End-to-End Encryption)


## REST

Representational State Transfer

- REST is a pattern, a convention to organize our url structure

  - Resource based routes convention

  - The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource.

  - REST uses a resource identifier to identify the particular resource involved in an interaction between components.

  - It should use http verbs to express what the request wants to accomplish
  - Resource information must be part of the url
  - It uses common data formats (JSON for API)
  - Communication is stateless
  - Each request must pass all information needed to fulfill the request
  - Idempotency of requests

### http methods

What language does a client use to makes request to the server ? http

http protocol gives us verbs

- Create => Create a new ressource => Post
- Read => Get a resource => Get
- Update => Change a resource => Put
- Delete => Delete a resource => Delete

### Scoping information

- collections vs single entity
- which one?

### End Points

By following REST principles, it allows us to design our end points:

| Action                                | http verb | end point                |
| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| List all quotes                       | GET       | get '/quotes'            |
| Get a specific quote                  | GET       | get '/quotes/:id'        |
| Display the new form                  | GET       | get '/quotes/new         |
| Create a new quote                    | POST      | post '/quotes            |
| Display the form for updating a quote | GET       | get '/quotes/:id/update' |
| Update the quotes                     | PUT       | put '/quotes/:id         |
| Deleting a specific quote             | DELETE    | delete '/quotes:id'      |


## Middleware

- Middleware is a piece of software that sits in between the request and the response.

## Better Organize our Code

We can better organize our code to make more modular and to clean up our server file.

- Routing

  - We externalize to our routes into specific files
  - All the routes for a particular resource would be in one file

- We can use modules to externalize:

  - our DB files
  - our helper functions
